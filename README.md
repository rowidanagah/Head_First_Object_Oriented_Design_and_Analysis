#### The Liskov substitution Principle *lsp*

*lsp* is all about well-organized & well-designed inheritance. when you inherit from a base class, you must be able to substitute your subclass.

- It's all about substitution.

- *LSP* reveals problems about inheritance.

### Composition 

Composition is most powerful when you want to use behavior to be defined in an interface.

- It allows you to use behavior from a family of other classes, and to chang that behavior at the runtime.

- When an objects composed of other objects and that owing object is destroyed, the obj that are pert of the composition go away too.

- *Composition* is about ownership. _the main obj *owns* the composed behavior_.  


### Aggregation 

*Aggregation* is used when  one class ia used as a part of another class, yet still exists outside of that other class

- It's a variation in composition.
